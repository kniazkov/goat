# Goat
**Goat** is a high-level, dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based, multi-paradigm, and interpreted programming language, based mostly on JavaScript syntax. It supports the basic functionality of JavaScript, but besides, it adds support for multithreading, multiple inheritance, operator overloading (like in C ++), has simplified and expanded syntax and data model, and so on.

The interpreter (engine) of the programming language is completely developed from scratch. The interpreter is a very small program and can be easily compiled and started on different platforms, including Windows and Linux (both x86 and ARM).
